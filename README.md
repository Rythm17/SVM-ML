# SVM-ML

This project aims to enhance the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) by optimizing its parameters. By using techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search, we tune hyperparameters to achieve superior results for a classification task. The project is implemented in Python, leveraging scikit-learn for machine learning and optimization operations. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are robust supervised learning models applied for classification and regression purposes.
